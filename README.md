Replication material for "Searching for the Cartel Party: Inter-Party Collusion and Legislative Activity" as presented at [EPSA 2018][epsa2018].

[epsa2018]: http://www.epsanet.org/conference-2018/

The code turns [legislative cosponsorship data][parlnet] into a panel dataset of political parties nested into country-specific parliamentary chambers. Some parties are observed at several points throughout the period under examination. Some aspects of the panel data related to party-specific cosponsorship behaviour are then modelled via (one-part) [fractional response regression models][frm].
